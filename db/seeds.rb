#                                       nominee has come under fire for giving paid speeches to big banks
#                                       after leaving her post as Secretary of State.
#                                       Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made a good living giving speeches.
#                                       According to records Hillary Clinton has released, she made millions of dollars from speaking to big banks.
#                                       Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders repeatedly called on Clinton to share exactly what she said at those
#                                       events. She refused -- but last week Wikileaks published what appear to be transcripts. The Clinton team declined to comment on their authenticity.
#                                       In her speeches at Goldman, Clinton discussed topics ranging from intervention in Syria to financial regulation. Her
#                                       remarks had not been made public when the 'GPS' interview with Blankfein was taped.

#                                       In the CNN interview, Blankfein pitched his firm's relationship with the Clintons as part of doing business. He pointed
#                                       out that Clinton had been a New York senator and said Goldman regularly engages with a host of public officials in the state where it's headquartered.
#                                       'I go out and I meet with editors of newspapers,' he said. 'I meet with Republican leaders. It's necessary for us to do that.'
#                                       He expressed confidence Clinton would win the election in November.
#                                       'If the worst thing was that we have a history of having engaged positively with Hillary Clinton, that's not going to annoy me,' Blankfein said.'",

#                                           documented in a variety of writings, myths and legends stretching back thousands of years. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, for example, wrote of a magical fountain in modern day Ethiopia that restored the youth of those who bathed in its waters, and Old Testament reckonings of the biblical patriarch Methuselah (grandfather of Noah) put his age at the time of his death at between 720 and 969 years. Nonetheless, modern reality pales in comparison to such accounts, as the longest verified human lifespan in recorded history is that of Jeanne Louise Calment, who passed away in her native France in 1997 at the age of 122.
#                                           One of the more unusual cases of asserted human longevity in modern times involved Chinese resident Li Ching-Yuen (also rendered as Li Ching-Yun), mention of whom started appearing in U.S. newspaper accounts in the 1920s accompanied by claims that he had been born in either 1677 or 1736. Li Ching-Yuen expressed his longevity formula in one sentence: 'Retain a calm heart, sit like a turtle, walk swiftly like a pigeon, and sleep like a dog.'Holistic medicine is all that we need
#                                           These days, even modern medicine agrees: 70% of all illnesses materialise because of negative thoughts or emotional stress. Illnesses attributed to this cause are called âpsychosomatic,â and they are the biggest headache of the whole mainstream healthcare system.
#
#                                           Sometimes several days of elevated stress is all that is needed to open up a gastric ulcer. Sometimes several years of it is all it takes to develop diabetes or heart disease, not to mention poor general health, lowered productivity, and lack of happiness. Doctors and scientists unanimously agree that our thoughts directly affect the activity of our organs and the state of our bodies in general. Ancient medicine is classified as holistic, because it takes care not only of the physical body, but also of the psyche, as well as one's personal lifestyle. This method allows one to remove the cause of the illness, rather than merely treating the symptoms, therefore stopping it from reappearing. Modern medicine, on the other hand, deals with the consequences of the illnessâbodily ailments. This is why the illness often comes back, since the cause of the illness is not actually being treated.
#
#                                           This is where one of the biggest secrets to health reveals itselfâour thoughts can heal us. There are multiple recorded stories that discuss people who were severely ill and healed themselves with the power of thought, despite doctors losing all hope. One of such impressive story tells us about Morris Goodman, who, in 1981, was involved in a plane crash and was supposed to die due to irreversible spine damage and a punctured diaphragm. The man's life was supported by a breathing ventilator, and the only movement he could do was blinking. However, this man was aware of the power of thought, and in just a few days successfully regenerated his own diaphragm and could breathe independently. He also consciously regenerated his damaged spinal cord and started to move all of his limbs. Doctors could not understand the situation at all because this just âcould not be happening.â After a few months, however, Morris Goodman began to walk again, and eventually fully recovered. This is only one of many cases that are happening all around us. Thoughts cannot only make the body ill, but can also help it recover from incurable diseases.",
